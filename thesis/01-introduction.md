## The Chilean pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai {#1-x}

Shanghai 2010 was the first World Expo in which Chile participated with its own pavilion [(Basulto 2009)](#basulto2009). It had previously remained unrepresented or joined forces with other Latin American countries. In the run-up to Shanghai, however, citing strong economic ties between with the host country, Chile decided to design and build a national presence at the exposition.

The main thesis put forward by Chile's 2010 pavilion concerned the exploration and support of a re-imagination of the modern city [(General Secretariat 2010)](#secretariat2010). It proposes an essential reason of why we, as human beings, choose to live together in cities: to live in relation to each other and our natural environment, where we create value for ourselves and others through trade and exchange. The pavilion attempts to show that forgetting this essential reason is the cause of many problems in the current modern city model.

Seemingly, the pavilion's thesis was related to explosive twentieth-century city growth seen in both China and many Latin American countries (the population of the capital of Chile itself, Santiago, grew from a population of around 300,000 in 1900 to just short of 6 million in 2000; [INE 1995, p.34](#ine1995)). In many cases, due to rapid urbanization and political turmoil, this growth has gone relatively unchecked, opportunistically resulting in private property, private space, and private concerns. Common to many of these cities are large inequalities in wealth.

In contrast, the thesis proposed increased attention for public property, public space, and public concerns. Concluding in a number of principles, it states that more collaborative relationships within a city create more value; that the public and collective concerns based on the unique characters of each city favor these relationships; that these should be in balance with private concerns; and that the city, its quality, and its culture, feasts, and leisure are for everyone.


### _City of relationships_, architecture by Sabbagh Architects

The 2,500 square meters pavilion, designed by Chilean architectural firm Sabbagh Architects, consists of a large prismatic, undulating transparent volume representing a central 'public' space. This space can be seen through the undulating steel-and-glass facade, surrounded by various thematic interior volumes piercing through.

The most important thematic volume is the so-called 'seed', which contains the central 'city of relationships' vision. The volumes are connected with wooden walkways representing urban streets, which all lead to the central space, representing an indoor public square. The central space houses most of the building program, with a cafeteria, shops, exhibition space, and event installations.

The main vertical load-bearing elements are the columns of the transparent facade. Aided by additional slim interior columns, they support the multistory truss spans that hold up the roof. In the back, the spans reach down to the ground to provide horizontal support. Elsewhere, horizontal support is provided by the opaque-walled interior volumes and similarly-styled entranceways, which consist of sheet metal-cladded frames.

The materialization of the pavilion takes into account its temporary nature. Except for the foundation, its elements can be fully disassembled, and recycled or reused. The supporting walls, columns, and roof spans consist of bolt-connected steel. A wood-and-steel mesh provides protection from the sun beneath the recycled-glass facade. The interior volumes, opaque for light control, consist of oxidized steel. Both laminated wood and plywood are used for cladding and flooring, all from renewable Chilean wood plantations.

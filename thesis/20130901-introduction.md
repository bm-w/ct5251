# Introduction

This website serves to publish my submission for the main _CT5251 Special Structures_ assignment. It comes in the form of a blog, following my progress as I make my way through the assignment's _architectural design_, _structural design_, and _structural optimization_ phases. Subsequently, the results will be compiled into a final report.


## A Chilean pavilion for Expo 2015 in Milan

The assignment concerns the architectural and structural design of a country pavilion for the 2015 Expo in Milan. The assignment explicitly states the Dutch pavilion as the design objective. However, I am currently residing in Chile, and exploring this South-American country's history, culture, and future ambitions. So, taking a slight liberty, I will be designing a Chilean pavilion instead.

The assignment leaves me free to choose the theme for the pavilion. As a guide, it contains some passages about the Netherlands (to paraphrase):

> ...a crowded, multi-cultural country; organized and efficient, living on soft-soiled land reclaimed from the sea; small in size, but known throughout the world for its creativity, ingenuity, innovation, and willfulness.

In contrast...

> Chile is an enormously large country (or rather, _long_). It is known more for its twentieth-century political struggles than its cultural traditions. It lives off the sea, on hard-soiled land fraught with earthquakes. Isolated by the Andes mountain range, its population is far more homogeneous, but polarized in wealth and believes.
> 
> Still, the country has the ambitions and potential to be an increasingly global player. It has long been the strongest and most stable South-American economy. It is an important exporter of agricultural and mining products: its wines as famous and crucial as its copper. And stretching along the Pacific coast, it serves an important role in trade routes to and from Asia, for both itself and the Central and Southern regions of the continent.

Chile has plenty to offer to create a unique theme and design. Only a few weeks ago, its government officially announced participation in Expo 2015 _{REF}_. At the same time, it put out the public call for submissions on the pavilion's theme and design, around the central theme of _feeding the planet, energy for life_. I will detail my own (unofficial) submission in a future post.
